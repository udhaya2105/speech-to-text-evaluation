# speech-to-text-evaluation
A speech-to-text system evaluated using WER and CER with noisy audio.  Healthcare insights dashboard created using Power BI. 
**Project Title:**Building a Speech-to-Text Transcription System with Noise Robustness****
**Description**
    This project implements a speech-to-text transcription system optimized for noisy audio environments using Wav2Vec2.
    It includes voice activity detection (VAD), transcription evaluation (WER/CER), and performance analysis. Designed for healthcare domains.
**Features**
   🎤 Noise-Robust Voice Activity Detection (VAD): Accurately detects speech in noisy audio using WebRTC VAD.
   🧠 Wav2Vec2 Transcription: Uses a pre-trained model from Facebook AI for efficient and accurate speech-to-text conversion.
   📊 Evaluation Metrics: Calculates Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER) for performance analysis.
   📁 Audio Preprocessing: Converts and normalizes audio files to meet model input requirements.
   📄 CSV Logging: Automatically saves transcription and evaluation metrics in CSV format for easy analysis.
   📈 Power BI Ready: Output data can be visualized in Power BI dashboards for performance reporting.
